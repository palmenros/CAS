# CAS
Casio Algebra System

This is a CAS (Computer Algebra System) project for the Casio FX-9860 GII written in C++.
It can be compiled with the CASIO Fx-9860G SDK.

Here are the features I want to implement:

* Natural formula processing
* Differentiation
* Integration
* Expanding
* Solving equations
* Matrix CAS
* Factoring of equations

I am just a student, and I don't have a lot of time to spend, but I will try to update the project whenever I can.
